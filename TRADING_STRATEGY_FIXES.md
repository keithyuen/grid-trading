# Grid Trading Strategy Fixes and Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes made to implement the correct grid trading strategy according to your trading plan. The original `main.py` had several issues that have been resolved.

## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing IBKRClient Class**
- **Problem**: `main.py` referenced `IBKRClient` but it wasn't implemented in `ibkr.py`
- **Solution**: Created a comprehensive `IBKRClient` class with all necessary methods for order management, position tracking, and market data retrieval

### 2. **Incorrect Calculation Logic**
- **Problem**: The calculation in `utils.py` didn't match your trading plan formula
- **Solution**: Updated `calculate_lot_size_and_interval()` to implement the exact formula:
  ```
  LotSize = (Cash + 0.87 * CurrentStockPrice) / (0.87 * 0.565 * CurrentStockPrice^2)
  Intervals = INT(Cash / (LotSize * 0.565 * CurrentStockPrice))
  Increments = 0.87 * CurrentStockPrice / (INT(Cash / (LotSize * 0.565 * CurrentStockPrice)) - 1)
  ```

### 3. **Missing Multiple Limit Buy Orders**
- **Problem**: Original code only placed one limit buy order
- **Solution**: Now places 3-4 limit buy orders at each calculated interval down from current price

### 4. **Incorrect Profit Percentages**
- **Problem**: Used same profit percentage for all trades
- **Solution**: Implemented correct profit targets:
  - Initial buy: 1.5% profit target
  - Subsequent buys: 2.5% profit target

### 5. **Poor Order Management**
- **Problem**: No proper tracking of open orders and position management
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive order tracking, cancellation methods, and position monitoring

## Trading Strategy Implementation

### Step-by-Step Logic

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Connect to IBKR Gateway
   - Get current market price
   - Calculate available cash (budget + realized PnL - committed cash)

2. **Lot Size and Interval Calculation**
   - Use the exact formula from your trading plan
   - Ensures enough cash to buy 100 shares even if stock crashes 87%
   - Calculates optimal intervals for grid placement

3. **Initial Position**
   - If no shares owned: Buy calculated lot size at market price
   - Place sell order at 1.5% above purchase price
   - Recalculate intervals with updated cash

4. **Grid Order Placement**
   - Place 3-4 limit buy orders at calculated intervals down
   - Each order uses GTC (Good Till Cancelled) to persist
   - Check available cash before placing each order

5. **Order Monitoring Loop**
   - Continuously check for filled orders
   - When buy order fills:
     - Place sell order at 2.5% profit
     - Place new buy order at next interval down
   - When sell order fills:
     - Record realized PnL
     - If no more sell orders, cancel all buy orders

## Key Features

### IBKRClient Class Methods
- `connect()` / `disconnect()` - Connection management
- `get_stock_contract()` - Create and qualify contracts
- `get_market_price()` - Get current market price
- `has_position()` / `get_position()` - Position tracking
- `place_market_order()` / `place_limit_order()` - Order placement
- `cancel_order()` / `cancel_all_orders()` - Order cancellation
- `check_filled_orders()` - Monitor order fills
- `count_open_buy_orders()` / `count_open_sell_orders()` - Order counting

### Database Enhancements
- Added `order_id` field to track IBKR order IDs
- Enhanced PnL tracking
- Added methods for order history and cleanup

### Configuration
- Added `paper_trading` flag
- All trading parameters configurable via `config.yaml`

## Testing

### Basic Test
```bash
python test_basic.py
```
Tests all components without placing actual orders.

### Connection Test
```bash
python test_connection.py
```
Verifies IBKR Gateway connection and market data.

### Full Test Suite
```bash
pytest test_ibkr.py
```
Comprehensive tests for all IBKRClient methods.

## Usage

### Start Trading Bot
```bash
python main.py
```

### View Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_dashboard.py
```

## Safety Features

1. **Paper Trading Default**: Set to paper trading by default
2. **Cash Validation**: Checks available cash before placing orders
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on exit
5. **Order Tracking**: All orders tracked and can be cancelled

## Configuration Parameters

```yaml
paper_trading: true          # Set to false for live trading
strategy_budget: 50000       # Total budget for strategy
crash_pct: 0.87             # Historical max drawdown
range_fraction: 0.565       # Based on drawdown model
profit_pct: 0.015           # 1.5% profit target
symbol: "TQQQ"              # Trading symbol
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Paper Trading**: Run the bot in paper trading mode first
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use the Streamlit dashboard to track trades
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune lot sizes and intervals based on performance
4. **Live Trading**: Switch to live trading only after thorough testing

## Risk Management

- The strategy automatically manages position sizing based on available cash
- Grid orders are placed at calculated intervals to ensure coverage
- Profit targets are set automatically to lock in gains
- All orders use GTC to persist across market sessions
- Comprehensive logging for audit trail

The implementation now correctly follows your trading plan and should provide the automated grid trading functionality you described.
